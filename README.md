## Shutdown

FlySky FS-i6X don't have a software controlled shutdown button, therefore do not switch off you device when you see small square icon in top right corner of main screen - it indicates that there are settings not yet saved. Wait until it disappears or use "Save all" option from main screen popup menu.

When to use "Save all" option:
* When you don't want to wait until square icon disapper before shutdown.
* With USB connected - when USB is connected then settings are not stored with standard delay.
* To save timers.

## Mode 1

With Mode 1 radio you may experience inverted gimbal movement and swapped gimbals on main screen. To fix this swap gimbal connectors (red-white one with black-white one).
